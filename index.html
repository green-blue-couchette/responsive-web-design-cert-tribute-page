          <p id="bio">George Müller, a contemporary of Charles Dickens, was all too familiar with the sights of orphan children trying to survive alone in the streets of England. He was a young man living a lifestyle of gambling, theft and promiscuity, turned Christian evangelist after a radical experience during a prayer meeting, who decided he wanted to make a change. During his lifetime, he cared for over 10,000 orphans. His legacy lasts to this day.
            <br><br>
            The success of his efforts is credited to an approach that many would deem to be a most unconventional one — the conscious refrain from any form of fund-raising, and the faith that God will provide.

          <h2 id="details" class="subsection-title">Notable details about the ministry of George Müller:</h2>

          <ul>
            <li>Müller never requested money from people for the needs of his ministry, but relied on prayer to God for supplying for these needs.</li>
            <li>Many times, Müller received unsolicited donations just in time before they were needed to feed the orphans he was housing.</li>
            <li>Müller meticulously documented the unsolicited donations received for his ministry. The documentation was made publicly available for scrutiny.</li>
            <li>Müller's efforts to educate orphan boys and girls, in trade skills that prepared them for adult life, even led to shortage of staff in factories and mines nearby the Orphan House.</li>
            <li>Charles Dickens once paid a surprise visit to the orphan houses of Müller, after hearing false rumors of starving children. Dickens was so impressed by how well the children were treated, that he wrote it up for the local papers.</li>
